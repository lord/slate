# SEC Hub Consumer API Documentation

This is the documentation server for the documentation generated by the Consumer API.

## Serve documentation locally

To display the documentation locally on http://localhost:4567, run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server
```

## How to update the documentation

Copy the Consumer API's `tmp/doc/index.html.rb` file into this projects `source/index.html.rb` file
to update the documentation.

## Generating static files

To generate a set of static HTML, CSS, and JS files for production deployment:

```bash
bundle exec middleman build
```

This will create a bunch of files in the `build` folder, which can then be deployed to a static file server.
