### Getting Started

Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

### Slate

In 2016, when re-writing the api documentation we chose [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

To update slate, follow the instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Updating-Slate).
Slate is built by [Robert Lord](https://lord.io) while at [TripIt](https://www.tripit.com/).
