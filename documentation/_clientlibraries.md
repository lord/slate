# Client Libraries
To simplify authorization and access to the PokitDok API, we provide client libraries for a number of programming 
languages. These libraries offer full access to the PokitDok API with a minimum of code, usually just a few lines. These 
libraries are hosted on [PokitDok's github page](https://github.com/pokitdok).

* Python - [pokitdok-python](https://github.com/pokitdok/pokitdok-python)
* NodeJS - [pokitdok-nodejs](https://github.com/pokitdok/pokitdok-nodejs)
* Ruby - [pokitdok-ruby](https://github.com/pokitdok/pokitdok-ruby)
* PHP - [pokitdok-php](https://github.com/pokitdok/pokitdok-php)
* Java - [pokitdok-java](https://github.com/pokitdok/pokitdok-java)
* C# - [pokitdok-csharp](https://github.com/pokitdok/pokitdok-csharp)

The following sections go into further detail on the underlying details of connecting directly to the PokitDok API. This 
is of use if you're implementing the APIs in a programming language for which we currently don't have a client library.
