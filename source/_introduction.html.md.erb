[Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) API 2.0 allows you to programmatically access and manage your organization's Smartsheet data and account information. The API allows you to do the following:

* Read and update sheets
* Manage folders and workspaces
* Administer users and accounts

You can view code examples in the programming language of your choice by clicking the corresponding tab in the dark-blue area in the rightmost pane.

## How Do I Start?

This documentation provides two [Getting Started](#getting-started) tutorials that walk you through making your first API call and interpreting the response to a GET sheet request. You may also want to bookmark or note the following resources:

* [Smartsheet Developer Portal:](http://developers.smartsheet.com) If registering, use a different email address from your paid Smartsheet account so you can test the API and make API calls
* Developer Newsletter (subscribe while at the Developer Portal using the *Get Developer Updates* form)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/smartsheet-api) using the "smartsheet-api" tag
* Additional [Getting Started documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/getting-started)
* Contact us at [api@smartsheet.com](mailto:api@smartsheet.com)

## HTTP and REST

### RESTful Architecture

The REST URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions.

To get a list of sheets, use the following:

 `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets`
 
This returns a list of Sheet Objects, where each Sheet has an “id” attribute.

To get details on the sheet with id 123456, use the following:
 
 `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`

This Id pattern is repeated throughout the API. Columns, rows, cells, comments, attachments, or any other data element have a unique Id.

If you don't want to make raw HTTP calls, Smartsheet also has several software development kits (SDKs) that provide a higher level interface for popular programming languages. For more information, see [SDKs and Sample Code.](#sdks-and-sample-code)

### HTTP Verbs

Call the API using the following [standard HTTP methods](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html):

* GET (to retrieve an object or multiple objects in a specific category)
* POST (to create)
* PUT (to modify)
* DELETE

### HTTP Status Codes

<%= partial "snippets/errorHandling.md.erb" %>

<aside class="notice">Smartsheet has custom error codes to help you troubleshoot issues. See the <a href="#complete-error-code-list">Complete Error Code List.</a></aside>

### HTTP Headers

Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and the response body data is returned as JSON.

The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:

Header | Definition | Example |
-----|-----|-----|
*Authorization* | Required for all endpoints, except for POST /token. The access token. | Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05
*Content-Type* | Required for POST and PUT requests. Defines the structure for the response. | application/json
*Assume-User* | Optional. Allows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate, the user to make API calls. The email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded. | jane.doe%40smartsheet.com

### Query Strings

Many API calls can be modified by including one or more of these common query strings: 

Query Parameter | Type | Description | More Info |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
pageSize | Number | Specifies the maximum number of items to return per page, for example, pageSize=25. | [Paging](#paging)
page | String | Specifies which page to return, for example, page=4. | [Paging](#paging)
includeAll | Boolean | If true, includes all results, for example, includeAll=true. | [Paging](#paging)
allowPartialSuccess | Boolean | If true, allows bulk operations to process even if one or more operations are invalid for some reason, for example, allowPartialSuccess=true. | [Bulk Operations](#bulk-operations)
numericDates | Boolean | If true, allows you to input or receive dates in numeric format, for example, numericDates=true. | [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times)
include/exclude | String | When applicable for a specific object, various include or exclude parameters are available, for example, include=formatting. | Object reference or [Formatting](#formatting)

<aside class="notice">Query strings are case sensitive. If you do not see the expected response, confirm that your query is formatted correctly.</aside>

## Authentication and Access Tokens

> Example Request: Authentication and Access Tokens

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me \
`-H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05"
```

```javascript
// Set the access token
var client = require('smartsheet');
var smartsheet = client.createClient({accessToken:'ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05'});

// Get current user
smartsheet.users.getCurrentUser()
	.then(function(userProfile) {
		console.log(userProfile);
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
    	console.log(error);
  	});
```

```csharp
// Set the access token
Token token = new Token();
token.AccessToken = "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05";
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).Build();

// Get current user
UserProfile userProfile = smartsheet.UserResources.GetCurrentUser();
```

```java
// Set the access token
Token token = new Token();
token.setAccessToken("ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05");
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(token.getAccessToken()).build();

// Get current user
UserProfile userProfile = smartsheet.userResources().getCurrentUser();
```

```python
# Create base client object and set the access token
ss_client = ss_client.Smartsheet('ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05')

# Get current user
user_profile = ss_client.Users.get_current_user()
```

```ruby
require 'smartsheet'

# Add your token to the config.json file
{
  "token": "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05",
  "sheet_id": "5091283781476228"
}
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@smartsheet.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "id": 48569348493401200
}
```

The Smartsheet API uses OAuth 2.0 for Authentication and Authorization. An HTTP header containing an Access Token is required to authenticate each request. 

If you want to get started quickly, or are developing a standalone application that can run with your credentials, follow these instructions:

1. Click the Account button in the upper-right corner of your Smartsheet screen and click Personal Settings. Click the "API Access" tab.
2. Click the "Generate new access token" button to obtain an access token.

The access token must be sent with every API call in an HTTPS authorization header. Once you have an Access Token, include it in the **Authorization** header for every request you make:

`Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`

The header name is **Authorization** and the value of the header is **Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05**. Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.

<aside class="warning">The token generated runs with your credentials. Be sure to secure your tokens and do not share tokens with anyone.</aside>

<aside class="notice">If your application requires users to be able to login with their own account, you must implement the full OAuth flow. See the documentation for <a href="#third-party-app-development">Third-party App Development</a> and <a href="http://developers.smartsheet.com/register">Developer Registration</a>.</aside>

## Dates and Times

The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, that is, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.  If a date/time needs to be
displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you must do the conversion using the user's time zone, which you can obtain by [getting the current user](#get-current-user).

You can optionally choose to receive and send dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using the query string parameter **numericDates** with a value of `true`. This query parameter works for any API request. 

## Sheets/Columns/Rows/Cells

Sheets are composed of rows, columns, and cells. A cell is identified by the Id of its row and column. The following table defines these terms and points you to places in this documentation where you can find more information:

UI Element | Description | More Info
-----|-----|-----|
Sheet | A Sheet can exist in a user's **Sheets** folder ([Home](#home)), in a [Folder](#folders), or in a [Workspace](#workspaces). It is comprised of Columns, Rows, and Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions. | [Sheet Object](#sheet-object)
Column | A Column Object *defines* the type of the column, but does not actually contain cells. The Column Id identifies the cells in a row. | [Column Object,](#column-object) [Column types](#column-types)
Row | A Row is a component of a Sheet or Report. Each Row is composed of a collection of Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions. | [Row Object](#row-object)
Cell | A Cell is a location within a Sheet that may contain a value. A collection of Cells comprises each Row in a Sheet. | [Cell Object,](#cell-object) [Cell reference](#cell-reference)

## Object Details vs List Summaries

Many of the List All commands, for example, GET /sheets, return only an abbreviated object for each object returned. For full details, read a single item, such as GET /sheets/{sheetId}. In many cases, you can refine the exact object properties to be returned by using include= and exclude= query parameters.

The JSON representation of the objects returned from the List All REST endpoints will only include a subset of the properties documented here. However, the objects returned from the Java and C# SDKs will represent the omitted properties with NULLs.

## Versioning and Changes

Smartsheet will add new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. Make sure that your code can handle new JSON properties gracefully. 
Also, make sure your code does not depend on the order in which JSON objects are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation. 

# Getting Started

## Make Your First API Call

Before you write any code, try executing API requests using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request and Response.

You must use an access token. See instructions at [Authentication and Access Tokens](#authentication-and-access-tokens). In the examples below, replace this sample token, "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05", with your actual token value.

To get a list of all your sheets, try the following command:

`curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05" "https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets"`

In Postman, the request looks like this:

<img src="images/postman-sampleb.png" alt="Postman screen shot">

The JSON result should look something like this (after formatting):
<pre class="center-column">
{
	"pageNumber": 1,
	"pageSize": 100,
	"totalPages": 1,
	"totalCount": 2,
	"data": [{
    "id": 6141831453927300,
    "name": "My first sheet",
    "accessLevel": "ADMIN",
    "permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A",
    "createdAt": "2016-01-28T22:02:35Z",
    "modifiedAt": "2016-08-09T17:50:06Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 6141831453927300,
    "name": "Sheet shared to me",
    "accessLevel": "VIEWER",
    "permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A",
    "createdAt": "2016-01-28T22:02:35Z",
    "modifiedAt": "2016-08-09T17:50:06Z"
  }
	]
}
</pre>

## How to Read a Sheet Response

Many Smartsheet API operations handle sheets, rows, columns, and cells. Each is identified by an Id and it is important to understand the relationship between these objects. Typically you loop through the columns to determine the Id of the columns you are interested in. Then you loop through the rows and contained cells to find actual values. The annotated sample response below illustrates these concepts by calling a very simple sheet called Employee Roster.

<img src="images/Employee_roster.png" alt="Basic sheet with 2 rows and 2 columns" />

Before you begin, you should already have an access token, which you used in the exercise above. Use the same access token for this walkthrough.

1. The first thing you must have is a sheetId. To find a sheetId through the UI, with the sheet open, click Sheet Actions in the left toolbar and select Properties. Note: use [List Sheets](#list-sheets) if you want to do this programmatically.

  <img src="images/sheet-properties.png" alt="Image of the Sheet Properties window" />

2. Copy the sheetId into the API call, GET Sheets, as below:

  `curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05" "https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/6141831453927300"`

3. The sample request and response are displayed below. NOTE: while JSON doesn't have a comment feature, this sample uses comments to help you identify the objects in the response.

<pre class="center-column">
{
  "id": 6141831453927300,                 // This is the Id of the entire sheet
  "name": "My first sheet",
    "columns": [{                         // Each Column Object associates column
                                          // Id to title and defines the
                                          // column details

      "id": 2517104256673668,             // Column Id identifies cells on a row
      "index": 0,
        "title": "Name",                  // This is the column name as seen
                                          // in the UI
      "type": "TEXT_NUMBER",
      "primary": true,
      "width": 150
    },
    {

                                          // which have the actual content

        "columnId": 2517104256673668,     // The column Id can be interpreted by

                                          // this is the "Name" column

      "value": "John Doe",

This core hierarchy of Sheet > Column > Row > Cell is essential to working with the Smartsheet API. As your user's sheets grow in complexity, the responses do too. This walkthrough has given you some navigational aid in finding the right value to plug into your API calls. Use the API Reference and the example language tabs to learn more.

# Other Topics

## Access Levels

Sheets, Workspaces, and Templates have an **accessLevel** attribute that describes the current user's access level to that object. 
This corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that are available through the Smartsheet UI. 
The **accessLevel** attribute has one of the following values:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
ADMIN | The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure of the resource as well.
EDITOR | The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of, delete or share the resource.
EDITOR_SHARE | The same as EDITOR, but with the ability to share the resource to other users.
OWNER | The user has complete control over the resource.
VIEWER | The user has read-only access to the resource.

# Third-party App Development

In addition to being a powerful work management tool, Smartsheet is a powerful application platform. 
 
As a developer, you may be building applications that allow any Smartsheet user to access their Smartsheet data. The following sub-sections describe next steps.

## Developer Registration

Third-party app registration and management is available via the Developer Tools. 
To get access to Developer Tools, you must first [register](http://developers.smartsheet.com/register) as a Smartsheet developer. 
Follow the instructions on the registration form to add Developer Tools to an existing Smartsheet account or create a new Smartsheet developer account.
 
Once you complete the developer registration, log in to Smartsheet to access Developer Tools.  

1. Click the **Account** button in the upper-right corner of your Smartsheet screen.
2. Now that you are registered as a Smartsheet developer, click the new **Developer Tools** option in the dropdown menu to open Developer Tools.
3. Before you can register your first app, you must complete your developer profile. Developer profile is a public profile that anyone can access to learn more about you and your applications.
4. Once your developer profile is complete, you can use **Developer Tools** to register and manage your apps.

## Register Your App

To build a third-party app, you must first register it with Smartsheet using Developer Tools:

1. Login to Smartsheet.
2. Click the **Account** button in the upper-right corner of your Smartsheet screen and click **Developer Tools**.
3. Create a new app and provide the required information, including name, description, contact info and a redirect URL. Redirect URL (also known as the "callback URL") is the URL in your app where Smartsheet must redirect after authentication is complete.
4. Use the generated app **client id** and **secret** to connect your app to Smartsheet. See [OAuth Flow](#oauth-flow) for details on how to use **client id** and **secret** to do that.

## Access Scopes

To access an end user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask for specific Access Scopes. 
The Access Scopes enable your app to communicate to the end users what type of operations it is performing. 
Access Scopes do not override existing Access Level restrictions. 
For example, having the Access Scope of WRITE_SHEETS does not allow your app to update a sheet on which the end user has VIEWER access level.
 
The Access Scopes are as follows:

Access Scope | Description |
-----|-----|
ADMIN_SHEETS | Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.
ADMIN_SIGHTS | Modify Sight structure.
ADMIN_USERS | Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization; create groups and manage membership.
ADMIN_WEBHOOKS | Create, delete. and update webhooks; get all webhooks; reset shared secret. 
ADMIN_WORKSPACES | Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing.
CREATE_SHEETS | Create new sheets.
CREATE_SIGHTS | Create new Sights.
DELETE_SHEETS | Delete sheets.
DELETE_SIGHTS | Delete Sight.
READ_CONTACTS | Retrieve contacts.
READ_SHEETS | Read all sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.
READ_SIGHTS | Read all Sight data.
READ_USERS | Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization.
SHARE_SHEETS | Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments.
SHARE_SIGHTS | Share Sight.
WRITE_SHEETS | Insert and modify sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.

<aside class="notice"><b>Additional Info:</b><ul><li>User-generated Access Tokens are granted all of these permissions.</li><li>Third-party apps must request at least one access scope, but should only request the scopes necessary.</li><li>Once a third-party app attains a valid access token, it can execute a <a href="#get-current-user">Get Current User</a> operation, regardless of which access scopes were requested.</li></ul></aside>

## OAuth Flow

Your app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
The following sub-sections describe next steps.

<aside class="notice">App registration and OAuth flow require HTTPS.</aside>

### Request Authorization From the User

To request authorization from an end user, direct your user to `https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize` with the following parameters through either a `GET` or `POST`. The parameter values must be URL-encoded:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
response_type<br/>(required) | Must be set to "code".
client_id<br/>(required) | Client Id for your app.
redirect_uri<br/>(deprecated) | If supplied, must match the redirect URL you [registered](#register-your-app) for your app.
scope<br/>(required) | Space-delimited list of [access scopes](#access-scopes) to which you are asking the user to grant access (note the spaces must be URL-encoded as "%20").
state<br/>(optional) | Arbitrary string returned to your app; intended to be used by you to ensure that this redirect is indeed from an OAuth flow that you initiated.

Here is an example of a URL to send your user as a `GET` request:
 
`https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&state=MY_STATE`
 
If your user has not logged in to Smartsheet, they are first directed to the Smartsheet login page. 
After a successful login, Smartsheet prompts your user to allow or deny the access scopes you requested.

### Obtain the Authorization Code

During the above steps for requesting authorization from the user, if the user clicks "Allow", Smartsheet redirects the user to the Redirect URL with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
code | Authorization code required to obtain access token.
expires_in | Number of milliseconds code is valid once issued; this is currently 599135 milliseconds, or approx. 10 minutes - you must obtain an access token within that time.
state | **state** string specified earlier.

If the user clicks "Deny", Smartsheet redirects the user to the Redirect URL with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
error | "access_denied".
state | **state** string specified earlier.

Other errors that may be returned include:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
unsupported_response_type | response_type must be set to "code".
invalid_scope | One or more of the requested access scopes are invalid. Please check the list of access scopes.

### Obtain an Access Token

> Request an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code={your_code}&client_id={your_client_id}&hash={SHA_256(app_secret|code)}' \
-X POST
```

```javascript
// Create hash
var hash =
  crypto.createHash('sha256')
    .update('Your App Secret' + '|' + 'Received Authorization Code')
    .digest('hex');
 
// Set options
var options = {
  queryParameters: {
    client_id: 'Your App Client ID',
    code: 'Received Authorization Code',
    hash: hash
  },
  contentType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
};

// Get access token
smartsheet.tokens.getAccessToken(options)
  .then(function(token) {
  console.log(token);
})
.catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
# [todo]
```

```ruby
hash = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest '{ your_app_secret }|{ your_code }'
smartsheet.token.get(client_id: '{ your_client_id }', code: '{ your_code }', hash: hash)
```


> Successful Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "e9x352a9mp4151le2505",
  "expires_in": 604799
 }
```

> Error Response:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "Smartsheet error number",
  "error": "OAuth error type",
  "error_description": "Error description"
}
```

Once you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to obtain an access token. 
To do so, make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required) | Must be set to "authorization_code".
client_id<br/>(required) | Client Id for your app.
code<br/>(required) | Authorization code returned in the [previous step](#obtain-the-authorization-code).
redirect_uri<br/>(deprecated) | If supplied, must match the redirect URL you [registered](#register-your-app) for your app.
hash<br/>(required) | SHA-256 hash of your app secret concatenated with a pipe and the authorization code.  The app_secret is never sent with the request. To obtain an app_secret, see [Register Your App](#register-your-app).

<aside class="notice">The "Get Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

Reminder: you can see what a success call looks like in the dark-blue area in the rightmost pane. 

Possible OAuth error types:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
invalid_request | The request parameters are invalid or missing.
invalid_client | The client information is invalid. Ensure your client id is correct.
invalid_grant | The authorization code or refresh token is invalid or expired, the redirect_uri does not match, or the hash value does not match the app secret and/or code.
unsupported_grant_type | grant_type must equal "authorization_code" or "refresh_token".

### Refresh an Access Token

> Refresh an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your_refresh_token}&client_id={your_client_id}&hash={SHA_256(app_secret|refresh_token)}' \
-X POST
```

```javascript
// Create hash
var hash =
  crypto.createHash('sha256')
    .update('Your App Secret' + '|' + 'Your App Refresh Token')
    .digest('hex');
 
// Set options
var options = {
  queryParameters: {
    client_id: 'Your App Client ID',
    refresh_token: 'Your App Refresh Token',
    hash: hash
  },
  contentType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'    
};
 
// Refresh access token
smartsheet.tokens.refreshAccessToken(options)
  .then(function(updatedToken) {
      console.log(updatedToken);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
      console.log(error);
  });
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
# [todo]
```

```ruby
hash = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest '{ your_app_secret }|{ refresh_token }'
smartsheet.token.refresh(
  client_id: '{ your_client_id }',
  refresh_token: '{ refresh_token }',
  hash: hash
)
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "e9x352a9mp4151le2505",
  "expires_in": 604799
}
```

Access tokens expire after 7 days. Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. 
Once you obtain the new access token, you must use it in place of the old one, which is no longer valid.
 
To do so, make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required)| Must be set to "refresh_token".
client_id<br/>(required)| Client Id for your app.
refresh_token<br/>(required)| refresh_token value that came with the access token.
redirect_uri<br/>(deprecated)| If supplied, must match the redirect URL you [registered](#register-your-app) for your app.
hash<br/>(required)| SHA-256 hash of your app secret concatenated with a pipe and the refresh token value. To obtain an app_secret, see [Register Your App](#register-your-app).

<aside class="notice">The "Refresh Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

### Get Basic User Info
Once you have obtained an access token on behalf of the user, you can fetch basic information (including user Id, name, etc.) about the caller using the [Get Current User](#get-current-user) operation.

# Work at Scale 

## Bulk Operations

The Smartsheet API supports a number of bulk operations that can operate on multiple objects.  Unlike single-object operations, bulk operations allow you to create, update, or delete
multiple objects in a single request. For example, if you want to update 10 rows within a sheet, do so using a single [Update Rows](#update-rows) request, rather than executing 10 separate requests - one for each row.

### Optional Bulk Operations

Several endpoints support *optional* bulk `POST` operations which exist alongside the standard single-object `POST`.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object or an array of objects.
Depending on what was passed in, the [Result Object](#result-object) returned contains either a single object or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is [POST /favorites](#add-favorites): you can
pass in a single [Favorite Object](#favorite-object) to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations are
noted as such in the API reference documentation.

**NOTE**: Most `POST` operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (for example, favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints do *not*
return an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items are simply ignored, and the [Result Object](#result-object) returned omits them.

### Partial Success

In general, the default behavior for bulk operations is to fail outright if any of the objects in the request are invalid for some reason.  If successful, Smartsheet creates/updates/deletes all objects in the request;
if not, no objects are changed.

However, there are some operations that support *partial success*, which means the operation still succeeds even if one or more of the objects in the request fails for some reason (for example, an object is invalid).  Partial success is 
*not* the default mode for an operation and you must explicitly enable it by using a query string parameter.  This is noted in the documentation for operations that support partial success.

<%= PARTIAL_SUCCESS %>

## Paging

The Smartsheet API contains a number of *index endpoints* (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with "Get All" or "List") which return arrays of objects.
Examples include `GET` [/users](#list-users), [/sheets](#list-sheets), [/sheets/{sheetId}/columns](#list-columns), and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning
you can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.

### Paging Query String Parameters
Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:

Value | Type | Description |
-----|-----|-----|
**pageSize** 	| number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to **100** if not specified.
**page**		| number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to **1** if not specified.  If you specify a value greater than the total number of pages, the last page of results is returned.
**includeAll**  | Boolean | If true, include all results, that is, do not paginate.  Mutually exclusive with **pageSize** and **page** (they are ignored if **includeAll**=true is specified).

<aside class="notice">Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you want all results at once, you must specify the <code class="prettyprint">includeAll=true</code> query string parameter.</aside>

### Paged Responses

Index endpoints all return paged responses via an **IndexResult** Object which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:
