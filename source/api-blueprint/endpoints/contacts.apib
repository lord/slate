## Contacts [/contacts/{contact_id}]

A contact is a person/entity with whom you have communicated.

A contact has several handles to send messages to it. A handle has a source to identify which inbox can send message to this contact:

| Source    | Description      | Example of handle       |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| `email`   | An email address | `calculon@pmomsbot.com` |
| `phone`   | A phone number   | `+123445678900 `        |
| `twitter` | A twitter handle | `@calculon`             |

Each pair handle/source is unique in your company. If you want to move an existing handle from one contact to an other, you need to delete it from the first one and add it to the other one.
