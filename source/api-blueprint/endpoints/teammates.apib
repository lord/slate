## Teammates [/teammates/{teammate_id}]

A teammate is a Front user, a member of your company.

A teammate can be available or not (determined by the boolean `is_available`). When a conversation is assigned to an unavailable teammate, to avoid it to be hidden from the other teammates, it gets unassigned automatically.
