# Preparation

Before you can use the go~mus Cash Point API you will have to register a cash point account with an API key.
Please talk to your contact person in order to get access.

See [detailed documentation on Public API](/public_api.html) for information on how to request the basic data
for events, tours and tickets.


# Orders

An order is the final result of a checkout process. An order can consist of tickets, events or tour bookings.

The server-side will do a final validation and return whether our order was successful.
In a success case a JSON with the valid order will be returned.

All orders placed by a cash point are assumed to be payed in place.

## Additional filters

The order endpoint for cash point users might configured with global access to all orders placed. To filter
for the orders placed by the cash point, the filter `only_my_orders` is provided:

- only_my_orders (boolean, true|false, default: all)

See [detailed documentation on Reseller API](/reseller_api.html) for information on how to create an order
for events, tours and tickets against the orders end point.

# Bookings

The cash point is able to access the global booking lists to e.g. display a by day list or the booking
list for events.

## Event bookings

The bookings for event dates can be accessed via the date bookings endpoint:


`GET https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/events/:event_id/dates/:date_id/bookings`

```shell
curl "https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/events/123/dates/456/bookings"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:
