#Aggregation SDKs

Geezeo is building a series of aggregation SDKs to provide a simplified, future proof implementation of Geezeo aggregation. 

Aggregation SDKs are meant to run on a partners platform, and provide a simplified interface to Geezeo aggregation.

The aggregation SDKs provide methods for searching for Financial Institutions, or Geezeo can publish a list of Financial Institutions nightly for consumption.
