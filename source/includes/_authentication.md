# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:




```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

Line5 uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Line5 API key by contacting Line5.

Line5 expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR_API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
