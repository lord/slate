To authenticate bills with your users, you may use the following flow.

### User Creation

1. User signs up in your app.
2. Make a request to the `/client` endpoint to retrieve a `clientId` to store in your database for future requests.

### Authentication

1. Search for the company you'd like to add from the `/company/search` endpoint.
2. Provide your user with a "bill authentication" view populated with the login fields retrieved from the desired company.
3. Have your user fill out their credentials, and then send those credentials to the `/auth` endpoint.
4. <%= config.brand %> will begin the authentication process and if successful, will return available [items](#auth-items).

### Bills

1. Requests can be made to the `/bill/list/{clientId}` endpoint to retrieve the list of authenticated bills and balance information.
2. Requests can be made to the `/bill/{billId}` endpoint to retrieve details on a specific bill.

### Payments

1. Provide your user with a "link payment" view to choose a payment method.
2. Link this payment method using the `/payment` endpoint.
3. By default, bills will be paid automatically by using the payment method on file.
4. To change this, you must make a request to the `/payment/settings` endpoint to disable recurring payments.
5. When recurring payments are disabled, in order to make an on-demand payment, one must be scheduled via the `/payment/schedule` endpoint.
