## userID

The `userID` is expected to be unique, and the max length is **256 bytes**. It is used by callstats.io to distinguish between different endpoints. The userIDs generated by the origin server and therefore the origin server decides if these identifiers are ephemeral or actual usernames.

callstats.io treats `userIDs` as opaque identifiers, the origin server MAY choose to pass the same identifiers as it is using or send a SHA1 hash of the username instead (where the username and domain are the ones used by the origin server). If you are not going to search by userID, we prefer that you use ephemeral userIDs.  Alternatively, we support internationalization, and non-English named usernames, we automatically encode all incoming `userID` strings into [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), and they are case-sensitive.

Typically, if the same user joins the conference via multiple means (devices or browsers) at the same time, the origin server MAY use the same userID. If the `userID` changes, the app MUST call `initialize()` again.

- localUserID: The local userID that creates the _PeerConnection_, this userID is used when calling `initialize()`

- remoteUserID: This is the userID of the remote peer, in a mesh topology this is the userID of the remote participant. Alternative, when communicating with a conferencing server there are two choices.

  1. Using multiple _PeerConnections_ between a local userID and conference server: The number of _PeerConnections_ perhaps uniquely match 1:1 with the number of participants in the session. That is, there may be one _PeerConnection_ which just sends media to the conference server and multiple _PeerConnections_ carrying _MediaStreamTracks_ (MSTs) associated with different participants. In this case, it may be advisable to use the `conferenceServerID` as the remoteUserID for the outbound media, and the actual remoteUserIDs for the inbound media.

  1. Multiple MSTs in a _PeerConnection_: There is only one _PeerConnection_ between the localUserID and the conference bridge and the _PeerConnection_ carries all the _MediaStreamTracks_ (MSTs) received at the bridge from the various participants. In this case, the remoteUserID is the name of the conference bridge (e.g., conferenceServerID). More discussion about this is covered in the following [blog post](/2015/07/17/api-update-handling-multiple-media-stream-tracks-callstats/).

## conferenceID

The `conferenceID` is a unique call identifier to associate all userIDs in a conference. Therefore, all participants in a common call MUST use the same `conferenceID`. It is also generated by the origin server and MUST be temporally unique (i.e., for the duration of the call), the origin server MAY reuse the `conferenceID` identifier again for separate conferences at a later time, after the previous call using it has ended. The maximum length of the conferenceID is **512 bytes**.

Like userIDs, callstats.io treats `conferenceIDs` as opaque identifiers, the origin server MAY use the same identifier as the one generated by the conference bridge, or use the URL of the page where the WebRTC call is taking place (e.g., www.example.com/conferenceID), concatenate current time-stamp with a random number, or pass a SHA1 hash of one of the above schemes. To enable internationalization, and non-English named conferenceIDs, we automatically encode all incoming `conferenceID` strings into [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), and these strings are case-sensitive. This helps you as an app-developer or WebRTC service operator to easily perform dashboard search by directly copy-pasting (e.g., インターネット, интернэт, ອິນເຕີເນັດ).

The origin server MAY reuse the `userID` within the same conference call, i.e., two or more endpoints report using the same `userID` and `conferenceID`. while this is NOT RECOMMENDED, the callstats.io will still attempt to distinguish these `userIDs` as distinct entities.
