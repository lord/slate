# Introduction

The REST API provides programmatic access to read and write Productsup data. Create sites, upload product data, enable export channels and more.

For PHP users we provide an API Client, please see the [Readme.md](https://github.com/productsupcom/Platform-API-Client/blob/master/README.md) 
for more information.

For testing our API, you can use the [Api Explorer](http://platform-api.productsup.io/ApiExplorer/)
