# Introduction

The REST API provides programmatic access to read and write Productsup data. Create sites, upload product data, enable export channels and more.

If you want to use PHP see the [Readme.md](https://github.com/productsupcom/Platform-API-Client/blob/master/README.md) on how to install the API-client

For testing our API, you can use the [Api Explorer](http://platform-api.productsup.io/ApiExplorer/)
