# Introduction

Welcome to the Markable API! 

Markable is a visual search technology company. We build technology solutions to help bridge the gap between publishers and brands. Our proprietary "lens" SDK is an invisible layer, integrating seamlessly into a company's existing e-commerce website, mobile application, and video platform. It's an easy cost effective solution to incorporate visual search into any business.

You can use our API to access Search API endpoints, which can get information on various products and brands in your database.

We have language bindings in Shell and Node.js! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
