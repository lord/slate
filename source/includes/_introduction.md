# Introduction

The DirtyLemon API is organized around REST.

## Content type

In order to send data to our HTTP API, a content-type header must be set to `'application/json'`.

## Versioning

When we make backwards-incompatible changes to our API, we release new dated versions. The latest version is `v1`.
