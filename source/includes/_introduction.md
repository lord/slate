You can use our API to access booking endpoints, which will allow you to book Sendle pickups, manage shipping, and oversee past and present orders any way you like!


Sendle API uses JSON. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

For all examples, we will be using [**curl**](http://curl.haxx.se/) from command line, but you are encouraged to make requests in whichever method you are most comfortable with.
