Human rights organizations believe these charges have been fabricated. The actual reason for their arrest was their criticism of the Azerbaijani authorities and their online activism, calling for peaceful demonstrations.\r\n\r\nShahin Novruzlu, who was only 17 at the time of his arrest, has lost his front teeth as a result of torture in detention. Mammad Azizov and Bakhtiyar Guliyev have complained of torture too.\r\n\r\nFrom 14 May 2014, Azerbaijan is chairing the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. This organization is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights. I am deeply concerned that there are civil society activists in Azerbaijan tortured and imprisoned solely for expressing their views and organizing peaceful protests.\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan must live up to the high expectations of the chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The NIDA activists must be immediately released.",
