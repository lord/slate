# Platform SDKs

Geezeo is creating platform specific SDK's to accelerate integrating our platform features into OLBs, mobile, support, or any other use case that you can envision.

These SDKs will follow best practices for the specific platform, and should significantly lower the barrier of entry for any integration project.
