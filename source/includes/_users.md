# Platform Users

The Yoyo Wallet platform is accessed by two different types of users.  

- Consumers
- Dashboard users

To interact with the API as a consumer or dashboard user you require a valid [session](#sessions).

## Consumers

Consumers are the people using the Yoyo Wallet powered applications.  They are *your* customers.

Once a consumer has registered with the Yoyo Wallet platform they are able to reuse their Yoyo Wallet account on any application using the platform.  They won't have to register again, or add their credit card again.  It'll just be there ready and waiting for them when they login.

## Dashboard users

Dashboard users are you, or your employees.  These users have access to the dashboard to browse and/or administer information specific to your Yoyo Wallet account.

Dashboard users are authenticated with an email address and a password.
