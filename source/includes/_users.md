# Platform Users

The Yoyo Wallet platform is accessed by three different types of users.  

- Consumers with mobile devices
- Dashboard users
- EPOS devices

## Consumers

Consumers are the people using the Yoyo Wallet powered applications.  They are *your* customers.

Once a consumer has registered with the Yoyo Wallet platform they are able to reuse their Yoyo Wallet account on any application using the platform.  They won't have to register again, or add their credit card again.  It'll just be there ready and waiting for them when they login.

## Dashboard users

Dashboard users are you, and your employees.  These users have access to the dashboard to browse and/or administer information specific to your Yoyo Wallet platform account.

Dashboard users are authenticated via a traditional web login.

## EPOS devices

Retailers supporting Yoyo Wallet will need have a Yoyo compatible EPOS (electronic point of sale) device configured to communicate with the platform.

Our Yoyo Accept application is also available for smaller independent retailers if they do not have a compatible EPOS device.
