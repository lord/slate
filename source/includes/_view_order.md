**state** | Identifies the current state of the order. Visit [Check for Status Updates](#check-for-status-updates) for more information. |
**order_url** | Specific url for order queries. After booking, this url becomes the point to check for updated information (state changes), labels and any other information related to the order.|
**sendle_reference** | Reference ID for a Sendle Order. References begin with an "S" and are an alphanumeric string six or more characters in length. |
**tracking_url** | The order's public tracking page. Tracking page updates as the parcel progresses from sender to receiver. The url can be shared and viewed without a Sendle Account and contains no personal information about either party. |
