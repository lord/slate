# Introduction
The steps below detail the API requests that need to be made to onboard an investor. 

## Authentication
You have been granted API keys that can ONLY be used for onboarding investors as per the instructions below.

This means you can use `Basic` HTTP authentication for these API requests.

Generally, the Goji API requires API requests to be [signed using HMAC](https://docs.api.goji.investments/#introduction-authentication).

The `type` and `version` need to be retained for the final call to create the investor. The `declaration` is the text that must be agreed to by the investor.

## Step 2: Load the investor Ts and Cs

There is no requirement to display all the terms (it can be a link), but the investor must agree to them.

The consequences of the failure of a bank holding Client Money for Goji's clients\n        include that there may be a shortfall in the funds held for you so that you may incur a potential loss.\n      </li>\n      <li>Where a Client Money balance remains unclaimed and provided Goji has taken the following reasonable steps to\n        trace the client and return the balance, Goji may cease to treat the money as Client Money and pay the Client\n        Money to a registered charity of Goji's choice.

The allocation\n        policy for each investment is based on a first-come-first-served basis. If it is not possible to allocate\n        investments to you, Goji may hold your subscription for participation in a subsequent issue of like investments,\n        although you will be entitled to request to have your unallocated subscription monies returned to you until they\n        have been committed.\n      </li>\n      <li>All Fluid ISA Bonds will be governed by the terms of the Fluid ISA Bond Instrument; the Fluid ISA Information\n        Memorandum; and these Terms and Conditions. To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between these\n        documents, the provisions of the Bond Instrument shall prevail over the Investment Memorandum, and the\n        Investment Memorandum shall prevail over these Terms and Conditions.\n      </li>\n      <li>Neither Fluid ISA nor Goji provide investment advice, legal advice or tax advice. In particular and subject to\n        clause [7], neither Goji nor Fluid ISA will not assess the suitability of an investment in light of your\n        personal circumstances and you are responsible for making your own investment decisions. If you are in any doubt\n        as to your own personal circumstances, you should seek such advice from an appropriately qualified professional.\n      </li>\n      <li>Goji will not facilitate investment where we are aware that it is illegal, although it is your responsibility\n        to ensure that you have complied with any relevant legal or regulatory restrictions that would prohibit you from\n        investing.\n      </li>\n      <li>You may request any cash that has not been allocated to an investment, including investment returns, to be\n        paid back into your Nominated Account. If you wish to replace your Nominated Account, you may request to do so\n        by email. Any alternative account must be in your name and be held with a bank or credit institution that is\n        acceptable to Goji.\n      </li>\n      <li>Payments to you will be made after deduction of any relevant tax.

No interest is payable on money held in your Client Money Account and no\n        fees are charged in respect of establishing your Client Money Account.\n      </li>\n      <li>There is no established secondary market for Fluid ISA Bonds available through this Website and so you should\n        normally expect to hold your Fluid ISA Bonds until the redemption date, or beyond, if there is a significant\n        default on the Fluid ISA Bonds.\n      </li>\n      <li>If you find a buyer for your Fluid ISA Bonds, you may sell them through Goji by providing us with details of\n        the purchaser, the price to be paid and the number of Fluid ISA Bonds to be sold. If the buyer wishes Goji to\n        account to the buyer for the investment proceeds, the buyer will need to be assessed by Goji as a person for\n        whom an investment in Fluid ISA Bonds is appropriate and Goji may decline its approval at its absolute\n        discretion. Goji may charge fees for registering a transfer of Fluid ISA Bonds as set out in the Fees section of\n        the Website from time to time.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n\n  <li><h3>Cancellation of Authority</h3>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Goji may cancel their obligations to facilitate and hold investments on your behalf at any time by email to\n        you and for any reason, including but not limited to breach of these Terms and Conditions, applicable law,\n        mis-use of the Website or account inactivity for a period of 12 months or more. Goji will act upon such a notice\n        of cancellation as soon as is reasonably practicable and Fluid ISA Bonds will be transferred into your\n        possession and any balance of money held in your Investment Account will be transferred to your Nominated\n        Account.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n\n  <li><h3>Complaints and Compensation.</h3>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Goji have established procedures in accordance with the FCA's rules for the effective consideration of\n        complaints.
