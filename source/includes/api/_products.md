## Find Product

> To get predefined specifications for a product use this code:

```http
GET /api/products/new?category_id=$['Product_Category_id']&product_name=$['Your_Product_name'] HTTP/1.1
Host: bizongo.in
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Token token="USER AUTH TOKEN"
```
> Variables `Product_Category_id` and `Your_Product_name` contains values for category id and name of the product. `User Auth Token` is the auth token value returned to user on sign in. This is success response returned for a sample product searched in `Crates` category with auto-populated values.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "keyword": {
    "values": "Multi Purpose Crates, Fruit & Vegetable Crates",
    "options": "Multi Purpose Crates, Dairy Crates, Fruit & Vegetable Crates, Dairy Crates"
  },
  "specifications": {
    "text_fields_specifications": {
      "Capacity": {
        "optional": false,
        "value": "10"
      }
    },
    "checkable_specifications": {
      "Color": {
        "options": "Blue, Bronze, Brown",
        "values": "Blue, Brown",
        "optional": true
      },
      "Material": {
        "options": "Wood, Steel, Stainless Steel, Paper",
        "optional": true
      }
    },
    "dropdown_specifications": {
      "Original": {
        "options": "yes, no",
        "value": "yes",
        "optional": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Bizongo uses the auth-token to allow access to the new product API and sends back an response which tells us about the specification for the product to be added. This api also returns auto-populated values of product if product is present in search. These specifications have already been defined by the admin they are either optional or required based on `optional` parameter.

Bizongo expects the header `Authorization` to be present in the following 'format'

`Authorization: Token token=User Auth Token`

Bizongo expects the header `Authorization` to be present in the following 'format'

`Authorization: Token token=User Auth Token`
