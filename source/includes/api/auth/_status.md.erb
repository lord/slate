An auth `status.type` can be a variety of types. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### verified

The user's auth has been verified. No actions are required.

### authenticate

The auth's credentials are no longer valid and need to be reauthenticated. Make a request to the `/auth` endpoint with updated credentials to remove this status.

### hold 

For a number of reasons an auth can have the status of `hold`. When an auth is on hold we'll present you with a `reason` that you in turn can present to your users. To remove this status, the user must take the appropriate action as described in the `reason`. This usually involves them needing to login into their online account. Once the user has completed the action, make a request to the `/auth/{authId}/fix-hold` endpoint to resume their services.
