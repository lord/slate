## Notification method verification

Adding a new notification method requires a verification process as outlined below.

  1. Make a request to `/client/notification/request-code` to send a verification code to a specified `destination`.
  2. Make a request to `/client/notification/verify-code` to verify the user has received the code sent to `destination`.

If `/client/notification/verify-code` responds with a `200` status then the verification process has been complete and the notification method has been linked to the client.
