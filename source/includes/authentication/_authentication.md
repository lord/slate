# Authentication

> At the moment no authorization is required, but, in the future, to authorize, use this code:

```shell
Coming soon
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
#curl "api_endpoint_here"
#  -H "Authorization: myPersonalKey"
```

> Make sure to replace `myPersonalKey` with your API key.

At the moment no authorization is required, but, in the future, Markable API will use API keys to allow access to the API. You will be able to register a new API key at our [developer portal](http://www.markable.us/developers).

Markable will expect for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: myPersonalKey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>myPersonalKey</code> with your personal API key.
