## Breaking News

Breaking news can be used to quickly push current events to users as they are happening. These stories may not be fully formed, and only require a headline. These Breaking news events can be linked to a story, after the push has happened.

### Linking to another story

The breaking news story can be linked to an existing story, or added later. Typically, clicking on the breaking news should take you to this story. The breaking news API will automatically fetch the latest headline and slug of the linked story.

### Story Group

The breaking news API accepts a *story-group* parameter, to give access to another breaking news sorter.

### API Documentation

Please see the [swagger documentation](/swagger/#/breaking-news/get_api_v1_breaking_news) for details on how to use the API.
