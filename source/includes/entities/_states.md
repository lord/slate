## States

MDLIVE is offered to our patients across all states in the USA.
However, each state has different regulations regarding how a patient
may have an appointment with a provider.

Currently only two states place a restriction on how a patient may have an appointment with a provider.

Idaho only allows patients to have an appointment via Video.

Arkansas allows patients to have video or phone appointments, only after they have completed an appointment via video.
