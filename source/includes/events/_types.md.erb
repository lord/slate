## Types of events

This is a list of all the types of events we currently send. We may add more at any time, so you shouldn't rely on only these types existing in your code.

You'll notice that these events follow a pattern: `resource.event`. Our goal is to design a consistent system that makes things easier to anticipate and code against.

Each event object includes a `payload.data` property which contains unique values for each `type` of event. Each event type below describes these unique values.
