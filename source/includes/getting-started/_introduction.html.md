# Introduction

This guide starts you on the path of unlocking the world of machine learning and AI.

We'll go through some of the major concepts you'll need before you get started writing **Inkling** files, connecting **simulators**, and training **BRAIN**s. We'll also tell you what we mean by all of that!

Then, we'll walk you through the steps to:

* install the Bonsai CLI (one-time task)
* create your first BRAIN
* load an inkling file and connect a simulator
* train your BRAIN
* use your BRAIN

We'll follow all of that up with our other resources that gives you the tools to keep going, like our Inkling Guide or our CLI Reference. You can also check out our examples and tutorials. If you want to jump right into the action, you can skip down to our [Let's Get Started][1] section.
