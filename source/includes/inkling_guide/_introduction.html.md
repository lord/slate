## Introduction to Inkling

Welcome to Inkling, Bonsai AI's unique programming language for training AI.

Inkling is a declarative, strongly typed language that abstracts from the vast, dynamic AI algorithms that require expertise in machine learning. An Inkling file contains the concepts, what you want to teach the AI, and curriculum, how you want to teach the concepts, necessary to train your BRAIN.

This guide contains the following sections to help you get started writing Inkling files:

* **[Fundamentals][1]:** An explanation of the various concepts you need to know for writing Inkling files. Learn about concepts, curriculums, schemas, and more.
* **[Examples][2]:** See Inkling in action. Check out some examples of Inkling code, and read our explanations of what and why. Then, try your had at one of our tutorials.
* **[Under the Hood][3]:** Inkling abstracts away from all of the ever changing AI algorithms that are out there, but if you want to know more about what's happening behind the scenes, check out this section!

And don't forget to check out our other [documentation][10].
