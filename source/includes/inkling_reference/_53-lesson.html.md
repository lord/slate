## lesson

Reference for the keyword **lesson**. Also, describes the keywords: **follows**, **configure**, **constrain**, **until**, **minimize**, **maximize**, **configure**, **with**, and **end.**

### What is it?

The **lesson** (keyword) declares an individual lesson for the concept being trained by the curriculum.  Lessons are contained within curriculum statements. A curriculum can contain multiple lessons.

### Why do I use it?

Lessons give you control over the training of the mental model. They allow you to break down the training of the concept into phases where each phase is implemented by a lesson.

### How do I use it?

> Below we show the clauses a lesson can contain.

```inkling
lesson lessonName
    follows prevLessonName
    configureClause
  trainClause
  testClause
  untilClause
```

Lessons allow the machine to learn the concept in stages rather than all at once. In the example below we show lessons that break into stages the task of  playing the game breakout. The first lesson, constant_breakout, trains the machine with a set of fixed values as configuration parameters. The second lesson, vary_breakout, which **follows** constant_breakout, trains the machine with a set of configuration parameters that vary according to specified type constraints.

```inkling
schema BreakoutConfig   # configured in configureClause
  UInt32 level,
  UInt8{1:4} paddle_width,
  Float32 bricks_percent
end

curriculum ball_location_curriculum
  train ball_location
  with simulator breakout_simulator
  objective ball_location_distance

    lesson constant_breakout
      configure           # configure to constant values
        constrain bricks_percent with Float32{0.5},
        constrain level with UInt32{1},    # e.g. level = 1
        constrain paddle_width with UInt8{4}
      train
        from frame in breakout_simulator
        select frame
        send frame
      test
        from frame in breakout_simulator
        select frame
        send frame
      until
        minimize ball_location_distance

    lesson vary_breakout follows constant_breakout
      configure          # configure to type constraints
      constrain bricks_percent with Float32{0.1:0.01:1.0},
      constrain level with UInt32{1:100}, # e.g. level varies from 1..100
      constrain paddle_width with UInt8{1:4}
    train
      from frame in breakout_simulator
      select frame
      send frame
    test
      from frame in breakout_simulator
      select frame
      send frame
    until
      minimize ball_location_distance
end
```

Lesson clauses have defaults so if a clause is not specified the default will be assumed. Also in certain circumstances not all  clauses are available. (The specific rules appear in the lesson clauses table below.)

The two lessons above are different in their configure clause. The first sets the fields in the configuration schema to constant values and the second lesson, vary_breakout, generates sets of values constrained by the type constraint. The syntax diagram below for constrainedType shows the syntactic rules for type constraints.

Note that the **constrain** name in the example above specifies a field in the configuration schema for the simulator. These fields in the example are bricks_percent, level, and paddle_width. When such fields are initialized with values from a type constraint they are often called placeholders.  This means that the name is is not the name of a specific value but rather it is the name of a range of values which will be input during training.

You can find more discussion of type constraint rules in the [schema][1] section. (Schema declarations can also use type constraints.)

###### Lesson Syntax

> lessonStatement :=

```inkling
lesson <lessonName>
  [follows <lessonName>]?
  configureClause?
  trainClause?
  untilClause?
  testClause?
```
‍

###### Lesson Configure Clause Syntax

> configureClause :=

```inkling
configure
  [constrain <configSchemaFieldName> with constrainedType]+
```

>  constrainedType :=

```c
numericType
'{'
  start ':' [ step':']? stop // 1:2:10. Called a 'colon range'.
                             // Specifies 'step' (default=1).
|
  start '.' '.' stop ':' numSteps // 1..10:5  Called a 'dot range'.
                                  // Specifies 'numsteps'.
'}'
```

> numericType :=

```c
Double | Float64 | Float32 | Int8 | Int16 | Int32 |  Int64 | UInt8 | UInt16 | UInt32  | UInt64
```
‍

The testClause and the trainClause have identical syntax except for their keyword (**train** or **test**).  However they both vary depending on the trainingSpecifier in the curriculum. The **expect** is only available in those cases that have known expected values, and that occurs when the trainingSpecifier is **data** or **generator**.

###### Lesson Train/Test Clause Syntax

> trainClause :=

```inkling
train
  fromClause
  send <name>
  [expect <name>]?    # only valid for data or generator
trainingSpecifer
```

> testClause :=

```inkling
test
  fromClause
  send <name>
  [expect <name>]?    # only valid for data or generator
trainingSpecifer
```
‍
The fromClause in the test/train syntax is used to name and describe the training data that is sent by the system (either from a labeled data set, in the **data** case, or by the generator or simulator) to the lesson.  Here is an example where the fromClause is shown in a curricululm which trains the machine to recognize line segments in an image. The generator segments_generator sends an image and expects num_segments in return. The returned num_segments is expected to match the generator's num_segments value.

```inkling
‍generator segments_generator(UInt8 segmentCount)
  yield (segments_training_schema)     # training will yield data with this schema
end

schema segments_training_schema
  UInt8{0:10} num_segments,
  Luminance(28, 28) image
end

curriculum segments_curriculum
  train Segments
  with generator segments_generator
  objective segments_objective
    lesson segments
      configure
        constrain segmentCount with UInt8{0:10}
    train
      from item in segments_generator # segments_generator's yield clause
        select item                 # specifies the appropriate schema.
        send item.image             # A field in segments_training_schema
        expect item.num_segments    # A field in segments_training_schema
end
```
‍
The untilClause in the lesson specifies the termination condition for training. The untilClause in our breakout example above was this:

```inkling
until
  minimize ball_location_distance
```
‍
This means train until the curriculum objective (ball_location_distance) is minimized. Here is the syntax for the untilClause.

‍

###### Lesson Until Clause Syntax

> untilClause :=

```inkling
until
  (
    [ minimize | maximize ] <objectiveFunctionName>
    |
    <objectiveFunctionName> relOp constantExpression
  )
```

> relOp :=

```
           '==' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>='
```

The untilClause is only required if the curriculum trainingSpecifier is **simulator**.  If this curriculum has a trainingSpecifier of **data** or **generator**, the until clause is optional. If it is not present, a default with value minimize will be created.

###### Lesson Clauses Table

Lesson clauses have defaults so if a clause is not specified the default will be assumed. Also in certain circumstances not all  clauses are available. This table specifies the rules. Recall that the trainingSpecifier appears after the keyword **with** in the curriculum.

Table for Lesson Clauses

###### Lesson Rules

* To summarize the table above, for a lesson associated with a trainingSpecifier of **data**: one or both of the lesson clauses **train** and **test** are required (and there are no default versions of these clauses).
* Test clause is optional for any particular lesson. However if the last lesson has no test clause it is an error.
* The _follows_ clause on the lesson is optional. **Note:** If there is no _follows_ clause and the lessons are executed in parallel, training will be slower.
* To summarize the table above: for a lesson associated with a trainingSpecifier of **generator** or **simulator**:
    - if neither the **test** or **train** lesson clauses are present, defaults for both clauses are generated. (See the above table for default details.) Otherwise, no defaults are generated.
* Lesson statements appear within curriculum statements.
* Lesson statements may contain the following keywords: configure, train, test, and until.
* Lessons appear after the objective clause in curriculums.
* Lessons can be ordered, using the **follows** clause. Note that this ordering is a suggestion to the instructor, not a hard and fast rule.
