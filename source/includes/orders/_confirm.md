This endpoint pays and queues an order:

  - Pays an order:
    - Sets the `shipping` object from the customer's shipping address unless already set on creation
    - Charges the customer's [credit card](#cards)
    - Sends the [customer](#customers) a confirmation email
  - Queues an order:
    - Creates [shipments](#shipments) for the order's line items
    - Marks the order as __queued__

For this action to be successful, the same conditions than for paying an order must be met:
