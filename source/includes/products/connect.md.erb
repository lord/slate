Connect is a drop-in module that provides a secure, elegant authentication flow for each company that the <%= config.apiName %> supports. Connect makes it secure and easy for clients to link their accounts, while doing the heavy lifting for the authentication.

Connect will emit events back to your app when a client successfully authenticates, exits, or times out.
