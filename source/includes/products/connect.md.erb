Connect is a drop-in module that provides a secure, elegant authentication flow for each company that the <%= config.apiName %> supports. Connect makes it secure and easy for clients to link their accounts, while doing the heavy lifting for the authentication.

### Events

Connect will emit events back to your app using the [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API or [WKScriptMessageHandler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkscriptmessagehandler) on iOS, allowing you to decide what to do after the user is finished.

Event | Description
----- | -----------
`auth` | The user successfully authenticated with a company.
`exit` | The user exited the module without completing an authentication.
`alive` | Emitted every 30 seconds to indicate that the user is not idle.

### URL parameters

The following URL parameters can be optionally passed into the Connect URL to customize the experience.

Parameter | Description

`companyId` | Deeplink to a specific `companyId`, skipping the search screen.
`cardPaymentsOnly` | Limit searches to companies that support card-based payments.
`items` | *CardSwap only:* Can be set to `swap` to automatically create a [Swap](#swap) once an authentication is successful.
