Please read how to create new users at [Bank Integrations Guide](#bank-integrations-guide).<br/>
This endpoint allows to onboard new users to TransferWise using email and registration code. 
TransferWise uses email address as customer unique identifier. 
When you are submitting an email which already exists among TransferWise customers you will get a warning that
"Youâ€™re already a member. Please login".

If email is new (does not have active user) then new user will be created.
