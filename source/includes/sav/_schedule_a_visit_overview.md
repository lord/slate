# Scheduling A Visit

MDLIVE helps you schedule consultations for your users.

You have the choice of scheduling the 3 types of consultations (video or phone) on MDLIVE:
<ol>
	<li>Future Appointment with a specific provider</li>
	<li>Immediate Consultation with a specific provider</li>
	<li>Consultation with the first available provider</li>
</ol>

Please be aware that the type of consultation which can be requested is subject to the Provider's availability, the users state of location, and the provider type the user wishes to see.

To learn more about state restrictions, please see our [states documentation](#states).

To learn more about provider type restrictions, please see our [provider types documentation](#provider-types).
