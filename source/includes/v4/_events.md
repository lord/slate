The detailed view for a single date provides all information needed to create for example an event date booking via the reseller API.
If date is registerable and an authenticatable user has the permission, this attribute contains a link to the public
registration form.

### Response

The JSON response contains more attributes than in the overview:

- vat_pct (float), the pricing tax rate
- discount (integer), discount in percent (0-100) to apply on total price for this item if ordered
- tax_included (boolean), whether the tax (if any) is included or not

plus a block of attributes for available seats (see below) languages, location and prices.

### Seats

The seats block contains four attributes:

- min (integer), minimum number of seats to book
- max (integer), maximum number of seats to book
- booked (integer), number of seats already booked
- available (integer), number of seats still available to book
- max_per_registration (integer or null), if not null, number of seats max allowed to book per order

### Location

The location block provides information about the event starting/meeting point and address.

### Seatings

Events can contain additional data for seating plans.
If the `seatings` array contains data, specific seats must be referenced in the order item when ordering (see prices).

A visual seating plan is provided in the seatings data as well as all the information needed (categories, rows, types, seats, blocked seats and reservations) for providing your own visual representation, or seat selection widget.
The visual seating plan is a standardized SVG graphic for display and manipulation via Javascript.

### Prices

The prices block contains one ore more price objects in an array. There are two types of price objects for event date bookings:

default prices with three attributes:

- group (boolean), whether the price is for the whole group or per participant (per seat)
- optional (boolean), whether the price is a choice or not
- price_cents (integer) price in EUR cents

or scale prices with following attributes:

- scale_price_id (integer) internal database id for the scale price definition
- seat_category_id (integer) internal database id for the seat category definition (only for events with seating plan)
- seat_category_title (string) title or the seat category (only for events with seating plan)
- title (string) title of scale price, e.g. "regular fee" or "reduced fee"
- description (text) longer, more detailed description for the scale price
- group (boolean), whether the price is for the whole group or per participant (per seat)
- optional (boolean), whether the price is a choice or not
- price_cents (integer) price in EUR cents
- vat_pct (float), the pricing tax rate


Usually, there will be one default price or at least one scale price.

```shell
curl "https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/calendar"
