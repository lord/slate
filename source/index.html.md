# Zibby API Documentation


The Zibby API is designed to be compatible with retailers on all
platforms, both custom and off-shelf.

The API is designed with the REST protocol and uses native HTTP
features like HTTP verbs and HTTP authentication, which can be
understood by all HTTP clients.

All requests and responses are in JSON format, including errors.

#Setting Up

##Authentication

>Sample Curl

```script
curl -X GET https://sandbox.zibby.com/api/v3/application/2398798 \

-H "Content-Type:application/json" \

-H "Authorization: Bearer 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
```

Zibby uses Oauth 2.0 to authenticate all requests
to the API.

During onboarding with Zibby, you will be provided an
access token that can be used to access protected
resources and initialize customers checking out  or applying with the
Zibby payment method.

Once you receive your Oauth access token you’re all set
to make requests to the Zibby API. All API requests must
be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will
fail. You must authenticate for all requests.

###Versioning

The Zibby API is versioned for major backwards
incompatible changes to the system.
The API is currently on version 3.0.

###Environment

To make the Zibby Integration as easy as possible, we
support sandbox and live environments. The two
environments have distinct Oauth keys and can be active
simultaneously. Data is never shared across environments.

###Test Endpoint:

#Applying with Zibby



##Request Verification Code

>Request Phone Verification Code:

```script

Method:			POST
Request:		{"phone": "1234567890"}
Response:		{"new_user": true}
Status:			202
```

To begin an application, Zibby requires that the consumer verify their phone number. This is done by sending an SMS message to the input number.



##Submit Verification Code


>Submit Verification Code:

```script

Method:			POST
Request:		{"phone": "1234567890", "code": "123456"}

```

Once the customer has recieved the SMS code, it must be sent to Zibby to complete the verication of their phone number.

               	 "email" : "jd@cognical.com",
               	 "income" : "50000.00",
               	 "ssn" : "431135234"}

```
The Zibby API Supports a multistep process for building the application once you have the uid.

To build the Zibby application for a consumer, the customer’s application data as shown in the Application JSON to the right should be sent in a PATCH request to Zibby with the new information.

##Submit Application for Underwriting

>Submit Application for Underwriting

```script
URL:			/api/v3/application/<uid>/preapprove/
METHOD: 		GET
Response: 		{"approved": true,
				 "approval_limit": "2000"}
```


Once the application has been built successfully, the final step in the Zibby approval process is to commit it for preapproval.

At this point, Zibby will make a full approval decision in real-time. If approved, we will return the approval amount in the response.


##Error Example

```script
Response: {"error": {"ssn": ["Invalid Ssn"]}}
Status: 400
```

When an error is encountered the system will return this response.

#Zibby Plugin Checkout

```script
<a href="#" class="btn-zibby-checkout">
<img src="https://www.zibby.com/static/img/btn-zibby-checkout.png" alt="Checkout with Zibby">
</a>
```

Place or name the Zibby checkout button within the payment options page of your site.

##Step 2

```script
<script>
// setup and configure cart
zibby.checkout.set({

	customer: {
		billing: {"first_name": "jane",
				  "last_name": "doe",
				  "address": "123 main street",
				  "address2": "apt 5b",

					"address": "123 main street",
					"address2": "apt 5b",
					"city": "New York",
					"state": "NY",
					"country": "United States",
					"zip": "10009",

				},
				items: [{
					"display_name": "4K LG TV",
					"sku": "LG-4k2352",
					"unit_price": 1399.99,
                                        "quantity": 1,
                                        "leasable": true
					}],
					checkout: {
						"customer_id": "10004323",
						"discounts": {
							"discount_name_one": 10.00,
							"discount_name_two": 50.00
							},
						"shipping_amount": 20.00},
						urls: {
							return: "https://yoursite.com/return",
							cancel:"https://yoursite.com/cancel"
							}
						}
					);
							// load zibby checkout modal
				zibby.checkout.load();
</script>
```

To check out with zibby, you must first initialize the cart object with the following information

1. Customer information - This is the billing and shipping information that the customer has already entered on your site

2. Item data - The contents of the customers’ shopping cart

3. Checkout data - Meta data on the transaction, such as the order id and any applicable discounts

4. URLS - These are the routes we will send the customer to at the end of the transaction

	a. The return URL is where we will redirect to after the customer completes their checkout. We will also POST to that URL the customer_id provided and the zibby_id associated with the order.

	b. The cancel URL is where we will redirect if a customer cancels a checkout with Zibby.

<aside class="success">Once initialized, the Zibby checkout modal can then be triggered.</aside>

#Post-Origination

Once an order has been originated, Zibby provides certain API endpoints to allow a retailer to manipulate the order. These enpoints are accessed by means of a private authentication token with which Zibby provides the retailer.

##Cancel Order

```script
URL: 		/api/v3/application/<zibby_id>/cancel_order/
Method: 	GET
Return: 	{"success": true}
```

The Zibby API allows retailers to directly cancel the entire order.

##Cancel Item

```script
URL: 		/api/v3/application/<zibby_id>/cancel_item/
Method: 	POST
Request:	{"items": [{"sku": "285868","display_name": "BATTERY","unit_price": 4.0, "quantity": 4}]}
Return: 	{"success": true}
```

The Zibby API allows retailers to directly cancel individual items within an originated order.

##Confirm Order

```script
URL: 		/api/v3/application/<zibby_id>/confirm_order/
Method: 	POST
Request: 	{"order_id": "abcd"}
Return: 	{"success": true}
```

Zibby's API allows for the retailer to be able to confirm an order once it is initialized in the retailer's downstream system.
