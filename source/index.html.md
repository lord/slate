# Overview

The Geezeo REST API provides a method of read and partial write access to a users PFM data. This API is for Partner use only, and is not designed or intended for use by the end user. In addition, security is limited to a Partner-wide access token at this time, so care should be taken that the token is not exposed to an end user.
