# Introduction

The API for The Growth App has been built around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). It uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We support [cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). [JSON](http://www.json.org/) is returned by all API responses.

# Authentication

> To access the API, you first have to request an `access_token`, by logging in.

```shell
curl "https://api.thegrowthapp.com/v1/auth/login?username=abc&password=def"
```

```javascript
import TheGrowthApp from thegrowthapp

const client = new TheGrowthApp('username', 'password')
```

> You may now use your `access_token` to access any resource your account is authorized for.

```shell
curl "https://api.thegrowthapp.com/v1/growthbooks"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

```javascript
client.growthbooks.all()
```

> When the `access_token` expired, you have to request a new one using your `refresh_token`. (You may also login for as many times you want)

```shell
curl "https://api.thegrowthapp.com/v1/auth/refresh_token"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

```javascript
# Our library automatically detects when a new `access_token` is required, and calls this method accordingly.
client.refresh_token()
```

We use [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) for authentication. Before accessing the API, you either have to signup to create a new user, or login using the credentials of an existing user. Requests will contain an `access_token` and a `refresh_token` as payload.

We expect for the `access_token` to be included in all following API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Replace <code>&lt;token&gt;</code> with your <code>access_token</code>.
