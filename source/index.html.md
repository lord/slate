# Introduction

Welcome to the Optisom Sleep Health Platform API! As an Optisom Platform Level 
Partner, you can use our API endpoints to obtain information on users, assessments,
challenges, diary entries and other information related to the your user's progress 
through the Optisom Sleep Health Program.

We have example code to query the API using Curl.  You can view code examples in the dark 
area.

# Key Concepts
The Optisom Sleep Health Platform encompasses several key concepts that are necessary to 
understand how to use the system properly. 
The easiest way to contextualize these concepts is to view them from the user's experience. This 
experience is primarily made of two use cases; screening and taking sleep health 
challenges.  

A screening consists of a series of questions that survey the user's sleep health.
Based on the user's responses to these questions, a sleep health report is produced and a 
set of sleep health modules are assigned to the user.  


These modules contain tasks, in the form of challenge cards, 
that the user can undertake in order to improve their sleep health.  As a user completes
tasks, points are awarded.  These points can be used to tie the user's progress to
incentive rewards, or as a part of creating competition between users and teams.

All attributes concerning the user, screening, challenges and more are accessible through 
a standard webservice API calls which responds with JSON data structures. 

As an Optisom Platform Partner, you should have been provided with an email login 
and a password to your Optisom Sleep Health API Service, which we'll refer to as "the API Service" 
going forward.  If you do not have the email or password, please contact Partner Support 
at <partnersupport@optisom.com>. This login information is used to retrieve information that 
populates the headers for subsequent calls to the API Service.

# Authentication



## Authentication Headers Format

The authentication information should be included by the clinet in the headers of each request.  
The headers follow the RFC 6750 Bearer Token format:

```
  Access-Token: Jap0KPYbYrdbs7fuPfcN2g
  Token-Type: Bearer
  Client: 3LNndC01Qcle0NTzSZMMDg
  Expiry: 1462471387
  Uid: partner_abc@optisom.com
```


## Creating an Authentication Token

Using your email and password, you can create an authentication token by posting to the 
API sign_in endpoint.

`https://partner_abc.optisom.com/api/v2/auth/sign_in`

<aside class="notice">
The email, password and domain name should be replaced with the information provided 
to you by our partner support team.
</aside>

> Request for authentication token:

```
curl -i -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{ "email": "partner_abc@optisom.com", "password": "supersecret" }' \
  "https://partner_abc.optisom.com/api/v2/auth/sign_in"
```

> Abbreviated response:

```
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Access-Token: Jap0KPYbYrdbs7fuPfcN2g
> Token-Type: Bearer
> Client: 3LNndC01Qcle0NTzSZMMDg
> Expiry: 1462471387
> Uid: partner_abc@optisom.com
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> Date: Thu, 21 Apr 2016 18:03:07 GMT
```

## Validating an Existing Authentication Token
Previously issued tokens can be validated through the following request:

```
curl -X GET \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Access-Token: gqhY7hJ2Nwkld0dSSkta0A" \
  -H "Token-Type: Bearer" \
  -H "Client: RKhX7t2HkzLeenVevc4mww" \
  -H "Expiry: 1462471387" \
  -H "Uid: partner_abc@optisom.com" \
  "https://partner_abc.optisom.com/api/v2/auth/validate_token"
```

## Making an Authenticated Request
To make an authenticated request, use the following format:

<aside class="notice">
The Access-Token, Client and Expiry should be replaced with the values from the response 
for an authenticated token request.

</aside>


```
curl -X GET \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Access-Token: gqhY7hJ2Nwkld0dSSkta0A" \
  -H "Token-Type: Bearer" \
  -H "Client: RKhX7t2HkzLeenVevc4mww" \
  -H "Expiry: 1462471387" \
  -H "Uid: partner_abc@optisom.com" \
  "https://partner_abc.optisom.com/api/v2/users/1/screenings"
```
