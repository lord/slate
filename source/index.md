# Overview

Welcome to the NewsWhip API documentation. The NewsWhip API provides access to real time data trends, aggregate data, statistics, and social numbers for all content we have been tracking since January 1, 2014 - hundreds of millions of stories, fully categorized and ranked.

The NewsWhip API is language agnostic. Any HTTP client or library can be used with this API.

This documentation is open source. If you've found any errors, typos or would like to improve this document, feel free to send us a pull request: [GitHub](http://github.com/NewsWhip/slate).

# Authentication

All NewsWhip API endpoints require an API key. Your API key should be passed with each `GET` or `POST` request as a Query String.

`GET /v1/region/U.S./Politics/24?key=YOUR_API_KEY`

`POST /v1/articles?key=YOUR_API_KEY`

<aside class="warning">Your API key should be treated as a password. It should be kept secret at all times.</aside>

## Getting API Access

Our API is made available to NewsWhip clients and developers who wish to work with streams of trending content in any niche. Right now, it's powering widgets on major news sites, internal dashboards, and mobile apps in Europe and North America.

For details on getting access, email: [api@newswhip.com](mailto:api@newswhip.com).

# Rate Limits

Each API key is limited by default to 100 API requests per 5 minutes. Once you exceed this limit, calls will return: 

Error Code | Meaning
---------- | -------
429 | Too Many Requests -- You're requesting too many kittens! Slow down!

<aside class="notice">Contact us at api@newswhip.com if your application requires higher limits.</aside>

# API Endpoints

NewsWhip provides 2 different endpoints designed for different use cases, each available at varying commercial rates.

* `GET` requests: best suited for finding real-time trending articles in any niche and social network, with or without video and published in any country up to a week ago.
* `POST` requests: best suited for very precise article filtering, real-time analytics, aggregations and reporting. These APIs slice and dice our data in any form you want.

### HTTPS Endpoint
`https://api.newswhip.com/`

# GET Requests

The real-time GET API endpoints are designed to mirror Spike's functionality. You can get all trending content in any Niche or Region, ordered by any social metric.

There are 4 different endpoints:

* `GET /v1/region/{region}/{category}/{time_period}`
* `GET /v1/publisher/{publisher}/{time_period}`
* `GET /v1/local/{city}/All/{time_period}`
* `GET /v1/search?q={search_term}`

All 4 GET endpoints accept the following Query Parameters:

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
video_only | false | If set to true, the result will ONLY include content with embedded video.
sort_by | default | Defines how the articles are ranked. Accepts one of the following: `default`, `fb_likes`, `fb_shares`, `fb_comments`, `fb_total`, `twitter`, `linkedin`, `fb_tw_and_li`, `nw_score`, `nw_max_score`
size |  | Number of articles to be returned (including related articles).
