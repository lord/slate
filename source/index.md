# Welcome

Welcome to Dexter! Get ready to build the world. In a code sense, of course - not in a bulldozer-and-crane sense. Or even in a minecraft sense. More in the sense of throwing byte-sized bricks and using them to build the software skyscraper of your dreams.  Or casting coded i-beams to build a business bridge like no one has seen before.

# What you’re getting into
## Who’s who

Dexter means many things to many people. Well, more specifically, it means 3 different things to 3 different kinds of people, depending on how deeply you want to descend into our world.

Most Dexterous types start out as **users** - folks who sign up to find some App (a program written inside Dexter) and use it as its creator intented. Then you’ll find yourself tracking down more and more Apps as you figure out all the ways they can make your day-to-day life better. Life will be good.

After that, though, you’ll find you start to catch the bug. One App won’t work quite the way you want, or you really feel like mixing and matching features from two different Apps would start to be better. At that point you’ll graduate to being a **power user** - you’ll be using the Dexter App editor to build your own Apps to share with the world at large!

Eventually even that taste of power won’t be enough. You’ll crave more - the vast array of existing tools won’t be enought to satisfy your ever growing needs. You’ll find yourself driving to that final bastion of Dexter power - the programming SDK. Before you know it, you’ll have written Dexter modules that control the lights in your house, start your car in the morning, and feed your cat before you leave. You’ll officially be a Dexter **developer**.
