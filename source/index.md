# Introduction

Welcome to the Kuzzle SDK Documentation!

At this stage we only propose the generic specifications for our future SDK. We'll amend this documentation with code samples for each SDK we produce.

Our goal is to create at least a Javascript SDK and an Android SDK for our beta version of Kuzzle. Stay tuned!
