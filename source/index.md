# Introduction

Welcome to the Kuzzle SDK Documentation!

At this stage we only propose a draft for the generic specifications of our future SDKs. We'll complete this documentation incrementally, and add code samples for each SDK we produce.
This documentation has been designed both to help people use our SDKs, and to ensure that all our SDKs will follow the same global architecture.

Our goal is to create at least a Javascript SDK and an Android SDK for our beta version of Kuzzle. Stay tuned!
