# Introduction

The Vestorly API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).
