# About


Faria provides integrated information systems for international education and business.​

[ManageBac](https://www.managebac.com) our flagship service is the leading planning, assessment and reporting system for IB world schools founded by three former IB Diploma students in 2007.

Today [ManageBac](https://www.managebac.com) is the trusted choice of 8 in 10 IB Diploma students at over 1,300 leading schools.

After nearly seven years of continuous development, we have re-imagined the school information system and we are proud to announce our integrated suite together with [OpenApply](www.openapply.com) for admissions & enrollment and InterSIS for school information management.

[ManageBac](https://www.managebac.com) , [OpenApply](www.openapply.com) and [iSAMS](www.isams.co.uk) provide an integrated cloud-based solution for international schools with curriculum planning, assessment & reporting and a robust core management information system linked with two-way data synchronisation and LaunchPad single-sign-on.


LaunchPad for Single-Sign-On provides a single account that give users seamless, one-click access to iSAMS, ManageBac and OpenApply plus our suite of integration partners such as Finalsite CMS or School Cloud Systems (Room Booking Systems & Parent Evening Systems).

Optionally, you can connect LaunchPad to your local Active Directory, Office365 or GoogleApps for Education account to link user accounts and to streamline provisioning.
