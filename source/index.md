# Introduction

The Vestorly API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).

# SignIn to Vestorly API

After Vestorly has provided a username and password, you can login to the API using hte following commands

```ruby
	
sign_in_api = VestorlyApi::SignIn.new('my@user.com', 'password')

begin
  authentication_token = sign_in_api.sign_in # vestorly-auth
rescue VestorlyApi::Exceptions::InvalidSignInCredentials
  # Do rescue stuff...
end

```

```shell
curl -X POST https://www.vestorly.com/api/v2/sessions
  -d "username=USERNAME"
  -d "password=PASSWORD"
```


# Using the advisor API object

Once logged in with a valid sign_in object, it can be passed to the `VestorlyApi::Advisor` to request on the advisor API part:

```ruby

# Obtain the list of prospective clients for the logged in advisor

sign_in_api = VestorlyApi::SignIn.new('my@user.com', 'password')
sign_in_api.sign_in

advisor_api = VestorlyApi::Advisor.new(sign_in_api)
advisor_user_entries = advisor_api.advisor_user_entries

# with query params
query_params_hash = { 'filter_by' => 'prospects' }
advisor_user_entries = advisor_api.advisor_user_entries( query_params_hash )

```

> Return a list of active advisor accounts:


```ruby
sign_in_api = VestorlyApi::SignIn.new('my@user.com', 'password')
sign_in_api.sign_in

advisor_api = VestorlyApi::Advisor.new(sign_in_api)
advisor_posts = advisor_api.advisor_posts

# with query params
query_params_hash = { 'filter_by' => 'prospects' }
advisor_posts = advisor_api.advisor_posts(query_params_hash)
```

```shell
curl -X GET "/api/v1/advisors.json"
  -H "Accept: application/json"
  -d "vestorly-auth=<TOKEN>"
```



# Signout of Vestorly API

```shell
curl -H "x-vestorly-auth:$auth_token"  \
-X DELETE https://www.vestorly.com/api/v2/sessions/m
```

>The example response:

```json
{"message":"Successfully logged out."}
```


```ruby

# Creating an object and calling sign_out method
response = VestorlyApi::SignOut.new(authentication_token).sign_out

# Calling sig_out method on the class
response = VestorlyApi::SignOut.sign_out(authentication_token)

# response is a hash containing code and message keys
p response # { code: 202, message: "Successfully logged out." }

# with invalid authentication token
p response # { code: 404, message: "Not signed in. }
```
