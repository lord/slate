# About

Faria provides integrated information systems for international education and business.​

[ManageBac](https://www.managebac.com) our flagship service is the leading planning, assessment and reporting system for IB world schools founded by three former IB Diploma students in 2007.

Today [ManageBac](https://www.managebac.com) is the trusted choice of 8 in 10 IB Diploma students at over 1,300 leading schools.

After nearly seven years of continuous development, we have re-imagined the school information system and we are proud to announce our integrated suite together with [OpenApply](www.openapply.com) for admissions & enrollment and InterSIS for school information management.

[ManageBac](https://www.managebac.com) , [OpenApply](www.openapply.com) and InterSIS in concert provide the first integrated online learning platform designed for international schools with curriculum planning, assessment & reporting, attendance & behavior, parent access and a state-of-the-art billing & finance solution built on top of Xero – the world’s leading cloud accounting system.
