# Users
Once you have successfully authenticated against the Service, you will need to create an account on the Optisom Service
which you should associate to an account on your platform.  The Optisom Service requires an email address; if your
service also requires email address, this is the simplest way to associate the two accounts.

However, if your service does not use email address for user sign-in, a generic user identifier is also provided.
In this case, you will have to create a dummy email address to satisfy the account validation mechanism
on the Optisom Service.
