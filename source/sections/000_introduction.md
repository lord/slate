The Manage API v3 exposes the core data types and its relations of the Bulletproof ecosystem:

- Contacts
- Services
- Clients
- Accounts

The API follows the guidelines of [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) for structuring the data and
defining associations between the data.

The API is accessible by Bulletproof staff only.
