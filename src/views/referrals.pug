        .col-md-12

          h3.font-weight-bold.text-dark.mb-3.pricing-faq-text What is the rate used for USD to BTC conversion?
        .col-md-12
          p.pricing-faq-text The rate used for payouts is based on the global average price of Bitcoin at the time of payout. So if you've earned $500 USD in rewards for a given month, you will receive the equivalent value in BTC as calculated on the first day of the following month.

        .col-md-12
          p.pricing-faq-text No. There's no limit on the number of users you can refer. If 10 of your referrals become a subscriber, you earn $200. It's that simple!

          h3.font-weight-bold.text-dark.mb-3.pricing-faq-text Can I advertise on behalf of Quadency?
        .col-md-12
          p.pricing-faq-text Yes, you may advertise on any channels you'd like, so long as you don't misrepresent Quadency or make any false claims about our products. If you plan to do paid search advertisement (ie Adwords), you may not bid on keywords related to our brand, including "Quadency". Violation of this rule will result in termination of your referral account and forfeiture of any rewards earned.
