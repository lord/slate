# Creating a Component

One of the great advantages of MJML is that it's component-based. Components abstract complex patterns and can easily be reused. In addition to the standard library of components, it is also possible to create your own components!

We will soon publish a step-by-step guide to explain how to create a custom component with MJML 4. Meanwhile, you can find a guide on how to create a custom component for MJML 3 [here](https://medium.com/mjml-making-responsive-email-easy/tutorial-creating-your-own-mjml-component-d3a236ab7093#.pz0ebb537) (note that it won't be compatible with MJML 4).
